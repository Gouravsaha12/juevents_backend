## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the application running on your local machine.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd juevents_backend

### 2. Create the Configuration File (.env)

The application uses environment variables for configuration. Create a file named `.env` in the root of the `juevents_backend` directory.

Copy and paste the following template into the `.env` file, and modify the values as needed:

```env
# PostgreSQL Settings
POSTGRES_USER=juevents_user
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your_strong_password_here
POSTGRES_DB=juevents_db
POSTGRES_HOST=db
POSTGRES_PORT=5432

# FastAPI Database Connection URL
# Note: The username, password, host, and db name must match the variables above.
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://juevents_user:your_strong_password_here@db:5432/juevents_db"

# Application Settings
SECRET_KEY=your_very_secret_key_for_jwt
ALGORITHM=HS256
ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=30

### 3. Build and Run with Docker Compose

From the root of the `juevents_backend` directory, run the following commands:

```bash
# Build the API image (use --no-cache for a completely fresh build)
docker-compose build

# Start the API and Database containers in the background
docker-compose up -d

## âœ… Verifying the Setup

After starting the containers, verify everything is running properly.

### âœ… Check Container Status

Run the following command to check the status of the running containers:

```bash
docker-compose ps

### ðŸ“œ View Logs

To view real-time logs from your services, run:

```bash
docker-compose logs -f
